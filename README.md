## Supported Printer Management Systems

### OctoPrint

OctoPrint is a popular web interface for 3D printers. It provides a REST API for controlling the printer.

- Default port: 80 (http) or 443 (https)
- Authentication: API key required

### Klipper (via Moonraker)

Klipper is a firmware for 3D printers that works with the Moonraker API server.

- Default port: 7125
- Authentication: Depends on your Moonraker configuration

### Duet

Duet is a control board for 3D printers with its own web interface (DuetWebControl).

- Default port: 80 (http) or 443 (https)
- Authentication: Depends on your Duet configuration

### Repetier

Repetier-Server is a host software for 3D printers.

- Default port: 3344
- Authentication: API key required

### Bambu Labs

Bambu Lab printers use MQTT for status and control and FTP for file operations.

- Authentication: Serial number and access token required
- Requirements: Printer must be on the same network or have cloud connection enabled
- Compatible with: X1C, P1S, P1P, A1, and other Bambu Lab printers

#### Finding Your Bambu Printer's Serial Number and Access Token

To connect to your Bambu Lab printer, you need two things:

1. **Printer Serial Number**: 
   - Look on the back or bottom of your printer for a sticker with a serial number (typically starts with "01P" or "01A" followed by numbers/letters)
   - Alternatively, open Bambu Studio, connect to your printer, go to Device > Device Management, and view your printer's information

2. **Access Token**: 
   - The access token is a security code needed to connect directly to your printer
   - For P1 Series printers: Go to the touchscreen, select Settings > Network > LAN Mode, and you'll see the access code
   - For X1 Series printers: Go to the touchscreen, select Settings > Network > LAN Mode, and enable LAN Mode to see the access code
   - For A1 Mini: Use the Bambu Handy app to connect to your printer, then go to Settings > Network > LAN Mode

**Note**: If your printer is not on the same local network or you can't find the access token, you may need to update your printer's firmware to the latest version to enable LAN Mode.

### Prusa Connect

Prusa Connect is Prusa's own cloud-based solution for managing their printers.

- Default port: 80 (http) or 443 (https)
- Authentication: API key required
- Compatible with: Prusa MK4, Prusa Mini, Prusa XL, and other Prusa printers with Prusa Connect

#### Setting up Prusa Connect

1. Make sure your Prusa printer is updated to the latest firmware
2. Connect your printer to your Wi-Fi network
3. Create a Prusa Connect account and register your printer
4. Generate an API key from the Prusa Connect web interface under Settings > API Access

### Creality Cloud

Creality Cloud is Creality's management system for their printers.

- Default port: 80 (http) or 443 (https)
- Authentication: Bearer token required
- Compatible with: Ender series, CR series, and other Creality printers with network capabilities

#### Setting up Creality Cloud

1. Install the Creality Cloud app on your mobile device
2. Create an account and add your printer
3. Enable local network access for your printer
4. Generate a token from the Creality Cloud app under Settings > Developer Options

## Available Resources

- `printer://{host}/status` - Current status of the 3D printer
- `printer://{host}/files` - List of files available on the 3D printer
- `printer://{host}/file/{filename}` - Content of a specific file on the 3D printer

## Example Commands for Claude

Here are some example commands you can give to Claude after connecting the MCP server:

### Printer Control
- "What's the current status of my 3D printer?"
- "Show me the list of files on my printer."
- "Upload this G-code to my printer: [G-code content]"
- "Start printing the file named 'benchy.gcode'."
- "Cancel the current print job."
- "Set the extruder temperature to 200°C."
- "Set the bed temperature to 60°C."

### STL Manipulation and Printing
- "Take this STL file and extend the base by 2 inches, then send to slicer and queue up in my printer."
- "Extend the base of model.stl by 1.5 inches."
- "Scale this STL file by 150% uniformly."
- "Scale model.stl to be twice as wide but keep the same height."
- "Rotate this model 90 degrees around the Z axis."
- "Move this STL model up by 5mm to create a gap underneath."
- "Can you modify just the top part of this model to make it 20% larger?"
- "Analyze this STL file and tell me its dimensions and details."
- "Generate a visualization of this STL file so I can see what it looks like."
- "Create SVG visualizations of my model from different angles."
- "Make the base of this model wider without changing its height."
- "Slice the modified STL file using PrusaSlicer."
- "Confirm that the temperatures in the G-code are 200°C for the extruder and 60°C for the bed."
- "Process this STL file, make the base 2 inches longer, slice it, and start printing, but confirm the temperatures first."

## Bambu Lab Printer Limitations

Due to the nature of the Bambu Lab printer API, there are some limitations:

1. **Starting prints**: Starting a print requires the 3MF project file path, gcode file name, print name, and MD5 hash. The simplified API in this server doesn't support this fully yet.

2. **Temperature control**: The Bambu API doesn't provide direct methods to set temperatures. This would require custom G-code commands.

3. **File management**: Files must be uploaded to the "gcodes" directory on the printer.

## Limitations and Considerations

### Memory Usage
- **Large STL Files**: Processing large or complex STL files can consume significant memory. The entire STL geometry is loaded into memory during operations.
- **Multiple Operations**: Running multiple STL operations in sequence (especially on large files) may cause memory to accumulate if garbage collection doesn't keep up.
- **MCP Environment**: Since this runs as an MCP server, be aware that Claude's MCP environment has memory constraints. Complex operations on very large STL files may cause out-of-memory issues.

### STL Manipulation Limitations
- **Section Modification**: The section-specific modification feature works best on simpler geometries. Complex or non-manifold meshes may produce unexpected results.
- **Base Extension**: The base extension algorithm works by adding a new geometry underneath the model. For models with complex undersides, results may not be perfect.
- **Error Handling**: While we've added robust error handling, some edge cases in complex STL files might still cause issues.

### Visualization Limitations
- **SVG Representation**: The SVG visualization is a simplified schematic representation, not a true 3D render.
- **Complex Models**: For very complex models, the visualization may not accurately represent all details.

### Performance Considerations
- **Slicing Operations**: External slicer processes can be CPU-intensive and may take considerable time for complex models.
- **Progress Reporting**: For large files, progress updates may appear to stall at certain processing stages.

### Testing Recommendations
- Start with smaller STL files (< 10MB) to test functionality
- Monitor memory usage when processing large files
- Test modifications on simple geometries before attempting complex ones
- Consider running on a system with at least 4GB of available RAM for larger operations
