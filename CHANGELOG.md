## Unreleased

### Safety

- Port the bambu-printer-mcp print safety gate to every Bambu print and heat
  route (print_3mf, start_print, upload_gcode with print, process_and_print_stl,
  set_printer_temperature). Each route inspects a private snapshot of the exact
  selected plate or G-code (every S/R heater target and tool change), enforces
  per-model hardware and declared-material ceilings, and checks a fresh MQTT
  report of the printer's model, serial, nozzle, state, errors and loaded
  filament before, after the human confirmation and again before dispatch.
- Ask a human through MCP elicitation before every print start and positive
  heating command. PRINT_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=0 (all printers) or
  BAMBU_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=0 (Bambu only) opts out for headless clients; a
  printer reporting a finished job still asks. Clients without elicitation are
  refused with instructions.
- Validate temperatures as finite, non-negative numbers before connecting.
  Heater-off (0) and cancel are never gated and cancel pending checked prints.
- Start remote files only after downloading and inspecting them, then start a
  uniquely named checked copy (Bambu, OctoPrint, Moonraker, Duet). Repetier,
  Prusa and Creality refuse remote starts because no verified download route
  exists; upload the local G-code with print=true instead.
- Gate OctoPrint, Klipper/Moonraker, Duet, Repetier, Prusa and Creality with
  shared thermal checks: independent nozzle/bed/chamber ceilings (defaults
  300/120/60 °C, server-only PRINTER_MAX_NOZZLE_TEMP, PRINTER_MAX_BED_TEMP,
  PRINTER_MAX_CHAMBER_TEMP), material ceilings, a declared material for
  positive nozzle heating (G-code filament_type or the new material argument),
  and adapter state checks that refuse printing, paused, errored, offline or
  unreadable printers. Klipper macro parameters that name a heater are checked;
  macro bodies on the printer cannot be inspected.
- Fix process_and_print_stl, which only logged a temperature mismatch and kept
  printing and whose check missed R targets. Expected extruder_temp/bed_temp
  must now equal the sliced job's highest S/R target or nothing is uploaded.
- Stop print_3mf from uploading the original project when auto-slicing fails
  or the selected plate has no G-code.
- Behavior changes: print_3mf compares bed_type (default BED_TYPE, else
  textured_plate) with the sliced plate's bed metadata, so a file sliced for
  another plate or without bed metadata is refused until bed_type matches.
  Moonraker complete/cancelled, PrusaLink FINISHED/STOPPED and Bambu FINISH
  count as a finished job, so the first print after a previous job always asks
  a human to confirm the bed is clear, even with confirmation opted out.
  Generic print uploads need a plain filename so the started file is exactly
  the uploaded one.
- Refuse raw FULU bridge print methods, printer messages and unknown methods in
  fulu_bambu_network_rpc; allow_mutating_method now covers only agent/session
  setup methods.
- Publish Bambu safety commands with string sequence ids and keep bambu-node's
  internal parser errors (H2-series serials, PAUSE to IDLE after a cancel) from
  terminating the server, without patching bambu-node.
- Fix OctoPrint nozzle targets (tool0 instead of extruder) and use the DSF
  raw-text /machine/code and PUT /machine/file routes for Duet.
- Evidence: unit tests and MCP-level tests with mocked MQTT/FTPS boundaries and
  loopback HTTP printer APIs. No physical printer was contacted, heated or
  asked to print; acceptance at a mocked boundary does not prove firmware
  behavior.

## 1.2.9

- Address Bambu FTPS upload failures reported in #22 by using TLS 1.2 control
  and data channels with explicit host identity and verified session reuse,
  including the Node 22/24 wrapped-socket session regression. Physical X1C firmware
  confirmation remains outstanding; no printer commands were sent in testing.
- Port standard Blender MCP discovery, tool forwarding, and verified STL edit
  support from the Bambu fork. Preserve this server's legacy shell/stdin bridge.
- Validate binary STL edits in bounded memory and cap ASCII inputs at 4 MiB.
- Apply edit deadlines and cancellation to STL validation as well as MCP calls.
- Require the Bambu model on raw print starts and upload-with-print, matching
  the fork's safety checks. Keep uploads without printing available.
- Isolate server and inline-upload scratch paths to prevent filename traversal
  and collisions from overwriting or deleting unrelated files.
- Refresh vulnerable dependencies, pin the supported bambu-node API version,
  declare the TypeScript build dependency, build before npm packing, and report
  the actual package version during MCP initialization.
- Keep generated dist files out of Git and validate clean builds, protocols,
  package installation, and Docker builds in CI.
